# CIS-252-Final-Project
This is a simple text-based RPG created for the final project in my CIS 252 (Advanced C++) class in 2018.

Follow the prompts on the screen. Enter either one of the listed commands (eg. "west", "save", "quit" etc.) or the number (or letter) corresponding to an item in the listed options in the current menu. The game only ends when the player has been defeated. Each battle the player wins rewards them with coins as a form of score-keeping.
